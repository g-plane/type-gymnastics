Also refer to a formal project: [typed-query-selector](https://github.com/g-plane/typed-query-selector).
- [C-printf Parser](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/c-printf-parser) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - Parse placeholders like `%d` and `%s` for a `printf` format string.
- [Integers Comparator](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/integers-comparator) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - Compare two integers that can be positive or negative or zero.
- [Query String Parser](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/query-string-parser) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - Parse URL query string into an object literal type.
- [Spec-compliant HTML Parser](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/spec-compliant-html-parser) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - An HTML parser conforms [WHATWG HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax) (may not be fully).
- [Tuple Slice](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/tuple-slice) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - `Array#slice` implementation at type level.
- [URL Parser](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/url-parser) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - Parse a URL into an object literal type with each component of the URL.
- [Pinia](https://github.com/g-plane/type-gymnastics/tree/master/src/pinia) by [Pig Fang](https://github.com/g-plane) - Type-level function which is similar to [Pinia](https://github.com/posva/pinia).
